This project addresses the short-term impacts of rising temperature on the phenology of plant-pollinator interactions. Focusing on the honey bee Apis mellifera, we examined whether experimental warming affects within-day foraging behaviour and plant anthesis onset. Next, we evaluated whether temperature-induced pollen composition change influences larval development. The data and associated code used in this study can be found as attached.

Description of the files:

1. bee activity new.csv: the data for analysing warming effect on bee foraging behavior, with the code bee activity.R.
2. indoor temperature.csv: the data for analysing changes in bee hive temperature due to experimental warming, with the code beehive temperature.R  
3. bee pollen new.csv: the data for analysing warming effect on the weight of pollen, with the code bee pollen.R. and NMDS.R 
4. Bidens anthesis.csv: the data for analysing warming effect on the time of anthesis onset (Bidens anthesis), with the code Bidens anthesis.R
5. feeding exp.csv: the data for analysing consequence of pollen composition change on bee larval development, with the code feeding exp.R
